# Class Based Styles
Class Based Styles are styles that can be applied without creating a CSS file. Just by linking the css file and editing the class of each element, it allows for quick prototyping and experimination for projects while minimizing the amount of files and effort required.

## Installation

Either download the cbs.css file or the cbs.min.css file or use the following code/links.
#### Regular 
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stellasphere/cbs/cbs.css">
```
#### Minified 
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stellasphere/cbs/cbs.min.css">
```
#### Latest
Use this to always get the latest version of CBS.

:warning: Requesting the latest version is dangerous because a new version may come with breaking changes. Only do this if you really know what you are doing.
